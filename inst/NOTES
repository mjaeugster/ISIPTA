* Authorship data for the ISIPTA proceedings
  - From 1999 to 2009 the data are scraped from the corresponding
    websites (code in =scraper/=).
  - Since 2011 we have "the raw data" (code in =importer/=).

** Scraper
   - Each =scraper/scrap-isipta*.R= file scrapes the paper data (id,
     title, author+email, keywords, abstract, pdf) from the webpage
     and converts them into an XML file =xml/isipta*.xml=.
 
** Importer
   - Each =importer/import-isipta*.R= file imports the data from the
     corresponding raw data file available in =raw/= and converts them
     into an XML file =xml/isipta*.xml=.

** Locator
   - =locator/locate-domains.R= reads all =xml/isipta*.xml= files and
     looks up the geolocation of each (email) domain; it creates
     =xml/geoloc_domains.xml=.
   - =locator/locate-authors.R= creates for each conference a XML file
     =xml/geoloc_authors*.xml= with the geolocation of each author
     based on its e-mail address. 

** RData
  - The XML files are controlled and corrected by hand and copied to
    =xml-cleaned/=.
   - =xml2data.R= takes all files from =xml-cleaned/= and creates the
     package =data= and =man= files.
